# APB-Based-SPI-Protocol
This project uses the AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol to construct a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) controller intended for smooth connection with a system bus.  Full-duplex serial communication between a host CPU and external SPI-compatible devices, including sensors, memory, and communication modules, is made possible by this module.  The architecture is appropriate for SoC integration because it offers programmable control registers, flexible data handling, and variable clock generation.

Tools Used 

Verilog/SystemVerilog – RTL design

Xilinx ISE / Vivado – Implementation & FPGA testing

Synopsys Design Compiler (DC Shell) – Synthesis
